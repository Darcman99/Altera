	description "They are tiny, they glow, and are insane weapons. The Ancient Drone Weapons. They are like rockets but better. They go right through the shields. It only takes a bunch of them to take out a capital ship, they are deadly. They might not seem deadly alone, fighting against a ship armed with one of these would be a mistake."

	description "The Ancients developed a weapon of massive caliber, specifically for their satellite defence system, the Titan Defensive System (TDS). The damage is insane, even the  Ancient Drone Weapons can't be compared to this. It forms plasma into a beam that burns through any kind of shielding in no time and without shields, they just rip apart nearly any ship before you even notice. However, the massive amounts of energy required make them practically useless without a ZPM, dual wielding one of these is out of the question."

	description "A much smaller and less deadly version of the Ancient Satellite Plasma. However, its smaller size creates a less concentrated beam dealing much less damage compared to its size, but this also makes it more energy efficient. Nonetheless, the damage outputted is still far more than any of the human weapons."
