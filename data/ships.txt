	description "The Aurora-class Battleship is an old Alteran warship, having seen use even in the Drak-Alteran War. A truly massive design, with a significant hull strength and a powerful loadout, capable of taking on Quarg warships by itself. Though the Alteran Military has given everything it can to keep it up to date, its age has started to show, as such, its battleship role is currently being replaced with the far newer Azrael-class Battleship, a much more effective design."
	description "However, it will not be removed from service in the forseeable future, mainly due to its secondary purpose as a mobile base, it is equipped with Alteran design long-range communications, capable of bridging hyperlan gaps, by creating a weak and unstable link, too weak for travel, but capable of transmitting comms. This communication system is an absolute necessity for the Alteran Military, but will cause a strong combat-oriented inefficiency, as it takes up a significant portion of the ship's interior."

	description "The Azrael-class Battleship is a recent Alteran design, stronger and newer than the Aurora-class, acting as a sort of replacement for ships of that class, at least for combat purposes. Unlike the Aurora, the Azrael was designed to be used as a dedicated frontline battleships. In order to be both more effective and efficient than the Aurora, more space was used for its weaponry, allowing the use of larger and newer Alteran designs, at the cost of proper long range comms that can be seen only on the Aurora."
	description "A single Azrael is powerful enough to take on a Quarg Wardragon head on, without issues, but will never be left unescorted, as it is very expensive to produce and such a loss should be prevented where possible. It is however not intended to be used as a command ship and will always work in conjunction with an Aurora, to ensure communication with Alteran space."
