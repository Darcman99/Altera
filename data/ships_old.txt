	description "A more advanced version of the Tarazed Osprey. The hull has been completely replaced by a darker and stronger material, the shields have been modified and more space has been made available due to various improvements throughout the ship. However, following Alteran standards, this is only a Light Warship, exactly what they needed to fill the gap in their fleet. The ship has been renamed to Trinity."
